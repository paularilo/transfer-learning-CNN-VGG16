**Use of state-of-the-art CNN architecture (VGG-16 model) for a new (unseen) classification task** 

Our pretrained model is the VGG-16  (Simonyan & Zisserman, 2014), a CNN architecture which achieves 92.7% top-5 test accuracy in ImageNet, a dataset containing over 14 million images (1000 classes).

Here we use it to classify flower images into three classes (dandelions, roses and daisies) and reach an accuracy level over 90%.
